    <p>This is our contribution to the
        <a href="https://www.canadianopendataexperience.ca/"><abbr title="Canadian Open Data Experience">CODE</abbr> 2015</a>
        edition that took place from February 20th to 22nd of 2015.
        The ultimate goal was to elaborate and build a web application basing it on the 
        <a href="http://open.canada.ca">Open Data</a> initiative from the Government of Canada.
    </p>

    <br />

    <p>This experience was really engaging and exciting for us. 
    We were complete newbies at first, no skills in web programming 
    or data analysis whatsoever, but we managed to get through the 
    learning curve and get our hands on this year's 48-hour sprint.
    </p>

    <br />

    <p>
    The biggest challenge we faced was coming up with inspiring ideas 
    by digging into the datasets. After long debates, we found that 
    addressing the <mark>Youth Employment</mark> theme was the dearest 
    to our hearts.

    <p><h4>So what is this app all about?</h4></p>

    <p>
    Our tool <kbd>I on the job</kbd> lets you match your field of work 
    with the right Canadian province. All you have to do is select your profile 
    and hit the go button to see your results.
    More about the results to come...
